# Create a Plant Model for the DC Motor

## Step-1 Identifying the Type of Wound

The type of plant model that needs to be build for the DC Motor is taken from the below reference;

Brushed DC motors are constructed with wound rotors and either wound or permanent-magnet stators.

### Permanent-magnet motors
Permanent-magnet types have some performance advantages over direct-current, excited, synchronous types, and have become predominant in fractional horsepower applications.
They are smaller, lighter, more efficient and reliable than other singly-fed electric machines.[2]

Originally all large industrial DC motors used wound field or rotor magnets.
Permanent magnets have traditionally only been useful on small motors because it was difficult to find a material capable of retaining a high-strength field.
Only recently have advances in materials technology allowed the creation of high-intensity permanent magnets, such as neodymium magnets, allowing the development of compact, high-power motors without the extra real-estate of field coils and excitation means. 
But as these high performance permanent magnets become more applied in electric motor or generator systems, other problems are realized (see Permanent magnet synchronous generator).
