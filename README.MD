## Running the Racecar Simulator
To get started with the simulator, first run the following in any shell:

>roslaunch racecar_simulator simulate.launch

Then open rviz. You should see a blue car on a black and white background (a map) and some colorful dots (simulated lidar). If you click the green 2D Pose Estimate arrow on the top you can change the position of the car. Alternatively use a joystick to drive the car as described below.
